This website was for a winery that needed a simple CMS to post wine reviews. Reviews contained a picture, a headline, a title, and a body, all pulled from a MySQL database. The homepage of the site simply showed a list of the 10 most recent posts, displaying the headline and providing a truncated sample of the body with a "Read More" link to the full post. The "Reviews" page itself had a paginated list of posts on the left, with the currently-active post highlighted, and the full article displayed on the right. I had never worked with a pre-constructed CMS and built mine from scratch using PHP. The code is not beautiful and could have used some revision, but it was a huge step for me in my website development endeavors.
